### Background / Scenario
In this research-oriented lab, you will research information about cloud computing security and prepare for a recommendation for an organization that is deploying their eCommerce option to the cloud.

A startup company is considering a cloud solution for their eCommerce business. The company designs and sells customized clothing and home decoration items to customers around the world. The company hopes the cloud solution can provide key functions including:

* Product search and display with multiple presentations (searching, zooming, and viewing from different angles, etc.)
* Product ordering (order confirmation, delivery tracking and notification, order history, etc.)
* Customer service
* Advertising and promotion
* Sales tracking and reporting

As an IT security specialist, you are asked to research and prepare a report evaluating potential cloud solutions and their security implications.

### Required Resources
* A computer with internet access

## Instructions
### Part 1: Research and Recommend a Cloud Model and a Cloud Service Model
Cloud models include public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud, and community cloud. Cloud service models include Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

Which cloud service model would you recommend to meet the feature requirements of the company? Explain.

* For fast-growing e-commerce startups on a budget, a public cloud model with SaaS services like Shopify or WooCommerce can be an ideal solution to build an online store quickly and efficiently, while still maintaining the flexibility to accommodate business growth.

### Part 2: Identify Shared Responsibility for Cloud Services and Cloud Security
Think about shared responsibility for security between the company and a cloud provider for the cloud service model recommended. Use the table below and mark each box with Client, Shared, or Cloud Provider.

Record your chosen cloud service model:

* Software as a Service (SaaS)

* Data -> Client
* Endpoints -> Shared
* Identity Management -> Shared
* Application -> Cloud Provider
* Network Control -> Cloud Provider
* Operating System -> Cloud Provider
* Physical Infrastructure -> Cloud Provider

### Part 3: Identify Five Security Threats Related to Cloud Computing
List at least 5 security threats related to cloud computing.

* Data Breaches: Unauthorized access to sensitive customer and transaction data.
* Insider Threats: Malicious actions by employees or third-party service providers that compromise the cloud environment.
* Account Hijacking: Attackers gaining control of user accounts, leading to data leaks or manipulation.
* Insecure APIs: Poorly implemented APIs that are vulnerable to attacks, leading to system exploitation.
* Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks: Overwhelming cloud services with traffic, preventing legitimate users from accessing the eCommerce site.

### Part 4: Identify Five Security Measures for Deploying eCommerce Cloud Solution
Perform an internet search to find out security measures required to secure an eCommerce cloud solution.

* Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits to identify vulnerabilities and ensure compliance with industry standards.
* Employee Training: Educate employees about security best practices and potential threats.
* Incident Response Plan: Develop a comprehensive incident response plan to address security breaches effectively.
* Third-Party Risk Management: Assess the security practices of third-party vendors and suppliers.
* Compliance with Regulations: Ensure compliance with relevant industry regulations, such as PCI DSS for payment card data.

### Reflection Questions
#### 1. What are some benefits of deploying online services in cloud?

Cost Savings:

- Pay-as-you-go: Reduce upfront costs by only paying for the resources you use.
- Economies of scale: Benefit from shared infrastructure and lower costs per unit.
- Reduced IT overhead: Minimize the need for on-premises hardware and software maintenance.

Security:

- Enhanced security measures: Leverage the cloud provider's advanced security infrastructure and expertise.
- Regular updates: Benefit from automatic security patches and updates.
- Data redundancy and backup: Protect data from loss or corruption through redundant storage and backup solutions.

Flexibility:

- Scalability: Easily scale resources up or down to meet changing demands.
- Agility: Quickly deploy new applications and services.
- Global accessibility: Serve customers worldwide without geographical limitations.

Mobility:

- Remote access: Access applications and data from anywhere with an internet connection.
- BYOD (Bring Your Own Device): Enable employees to work effectively from their personal devices.

Increased Collaboration:

- Real-time collaboration: Facilitate teamwork and knowledge sharing across teams and locations.
- Centralized access: Provide a single source of truth for data and applications.

Disaster Recovery:

- Business continuity: Ensure uninterrupted operations in the event of a disaster.
- Data redundancy: Protect data against loss or corruption.

Automatic Software Updates:

- Reduced downtime: Keep applications up-to-date with minimal disruption.
- Improved security: Benefit from automatic security patches and updates.

#### 2. Can the company rely on the cloud solution provider for everything including services and security? Explain.
* No, a company cannot rely solely on the cloud solution provider for everything, including services and security.

While cloud providers offer a wide range of services and security measures, there is a shared responsibility model in place. This means that both the cloud provider and the company are responsible for certain aspects of security and operations.
